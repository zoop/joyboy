# WebViewer UI 

WebViewer UI sits on top of [WebViewer](https://apryse.com/products/webviewer), a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that's part of the [Apryse PDF SDK](https://www.apryse.com). Built in React, WebViewer UI provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that interacts with the core library to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs that can be embedded into any web project.
